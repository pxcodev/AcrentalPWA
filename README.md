# Acrental PWA

### The system has been developed to manage contingency plans of a company, provides user manuals in PDF format, with steps to follow in case of any unplanned event.

### The system behaves as a mobile application and web page, through the use of Progressive Web Application (PWA), whose functionality allows it to be installed on mobile devices and desktop computers.
